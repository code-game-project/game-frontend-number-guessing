# game-frontend-template-svelte

A template for building game server frontends with Svelte and TypeScript.

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

After that you can start customizing the game view in [`src/routes/spectate.svelte`](./src/routes/spectate.svelte). Also don't forget to update the [`src/config.ts`](./src/config.ts) and the info in [`public/security.txt`](./static/security.txt) or delete it if you don't want to use it.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Canvas Framework Recommendations

Here are some framework recommendations for libraries that can be used to make a nice view for your game:

### [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com)
__Pros__:
- lightweight
- easy to use

__Cons__:
- less optimised for games (no camera or built in controls)
- only WebGL

### [Phaser](https://phaser.io)
__Pros__:
- made for games
- camera and controls built in
- canvas and WebGL

__Cons:__
- runs its own physics engine (not needed, because the server should handle physics)
- a bit heavier and slower than pixi
